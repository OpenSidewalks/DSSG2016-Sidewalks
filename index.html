            <h2>Vision</h2>
            <p>Sidewalks provide a primary mode of travel that supports nearly all other travel options, leisure,
                recreation and community activities. This project seeks to make <a href="#terms">pedestrian ways</a>,
                particularly sidewalks, first class members of an open data transportation network. The <a
                        href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a> (OSM) project has made available
                extensive, user-contributed open data on transportation networks, providing the basis for many use cases
                and downstream activities, including rich analytics, travel route optimization, city planning, and
                disaster relief. Some footways have been annotated in OSM as independent routes. However, sidewalks in
                the built environment have generally been treated an addendum to streets.</p>

            <p>As a result, sidewalks in OSM have spotty coverage and an unintuitive implementation. The current
                standard makes user contribution difficult and fails to serve many use cases, including the needs of
                people with limited mobility. This project proposes to jumpstart an effort to generate an OSM-based
                pedestrian network with global coverage.</p>

        <p>There are two phases to the proposed DSSG work, each of which represents a significant contribution to
            different stakeholder groups.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" text-align="left">
        <h4>PHASE I</h4>
        <p>The DSSG team worked to adapt an OSM data layer for use with sidewalk data, the group learned what nuances
            in the sidewalk data impact both standardized incorporation into OSM as well as ability to route. The group
            drafted an OSM standard for sidewalk representation and annotation with the following objectives:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Extension of the current OSM standard, focusing on innovation for pedestrian routing applications with
                particular attention to accessibility
            </li>
            <li>Compatibility with existing sidewalk data, as well as extensibility for manually added and municipally
                collected sidewalk data
            </li>
            <li>Data sharing - Facilitate importing and exporting of data through simple, clear standards for
                annotation
            </li>
            <li>Extended sidewalk data, in order to enable:
                <ol>
                    <li>Routing - Facilitate pedestrian routing with support for classes of different accessibility
                        features
                    </li>
                    <li>Basic visual map display - Support meaningful visual interpretations of pedestrian data (ideally
                        with existing rendering software) by capturing key features in a standardized format
                    </li>
                    <li>Annotation of significant accessibility features:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Terrain - Support annotation of incline grade that is compatible with OSM standards and
                                accessibility needs
                            </li>
                            <li>Junction views - Support detailed annotation of intersections and crossings of
                                pedestrian ways
                            </li>
                            <li>3D objects, landmarks, points of interest - Support detailed annotations of objects in
                                and features of pedestrian ways
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container" text-align="left">
        <h4>PHASE II</h4>
        <p>The DSSG team design and implement prototype tools to import sidewalk data from existing datasets and
            manual annotation. These tools must support recognition of potential conflicts between newly imported and
            existing pedestrian OSM data in order to facilitate supervised integration of new sidewalk information.
            Specifically, the DSSG team built and adapted:
        <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tools to facilitate users’ annotation of pedestrian ways, supporting:
                <ol>
                    <li>GPS-based mapping of pedestrian ways with endpoints indicated by users</li>
                    <li>Labeling of significant pedestrian features (as described above)</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Tools to facilitate importing of pedestrian way data from public sources, including:
                <ol>
                    <li>Supporting bulk import of pedestrian data from standard formats (e.g., geojson, shapefiles,
                        KML)
                    </li>
                    <li>Testing (of both the data specification and tool) by incorporating data from multiple
                        municipalities into a private OSM layer
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <div class="container" text-align="left">
        <h4>PHASE III (current)</h4>
        <p>Enable rapid scaling.  This effort is focused on 3 key areas:</p>
            <ol>
        <li>Incentivize/employ local ambassadors for hosting mapathons</li>
        <li>OpenStreetMap-focused software engineers to complete a mapathon-and-education-focused toolkit for streamlined data collection, and community management infrastructure in place for orchestrating global efforts (collaboration with Feet First).</li>
        <li>Build strategic plan for “NextTen”* urban centers for expansion (subgroup led by Urban@UW), establish regional local voting memberships inclusive of expanded region’s local groups. "NextTen" urban centers include:
        <ol>
            <li>New York City</li>
            <li>Washington, DC</li>
            <li>Boston</li>
            <li>Chicago</li>
            <li>San Francisco Bay</li>
            <li>Portland</li>
            <li>Pittsburgh</li>
            <li>Denver</li>
            <li>Philadelphia</li>
            <li>Atlanta</li>
        </ol>
        </li>

    </ol>
<p><small>*Urban centers identified based on rankings in <i><a href="https://www.smartgrowthamerica.org/app/legacy/documents/foot-traffic-ahead-2016.pdf">Foot Traffic Ahead</a></i>, a  walkability study published by Christopher B.

    </div>
    <div class="container" text-align="left">
        <h4>Future</h4>
        <p>Looking forward our goal is to expand OpenSidewalks providing accessible pedestrian routing solutions worldwide.  Our planned path forward is outlined as follows: </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Completion of a testing set of ten urban centers around the world, with accompanying alpha version of a global-scale accessible pedestrian trip planning service.</li>
            <li>Completion of any revisions needed to account for results of initial mapping efforts:
                <ul>
                    <li>Changes to the data model (updated at key testing locations), mapathon and educational mapping efforts, the pedestrian trip planner, and update software toolkits to reflect these changes. </li>
                    <li>With the data model/toolkits largely finalized, the project scales up (again) to include all cities and interested areas.</li>
                    <li>Automated sidewalk segmentation effort is finalized and deployed.</li>
                </ul>

            </li>
            <li>Global-scale pedestrian analytics and trip planning as data becomes more complete. Most cities will have had their pedestrian network mapped. New software tools will be written with a focus on data maintenance and revision.</li>
            <li> As cities move to sustaining the data model, efforts to add new data will focus on (likely rural) areas that have a much lower people-to-roads/sidewalks/paths ratio than urban areas.</li>
            <li> Project completion: all deliverables finalized, most edits to sidewalk-focused features in cities will be revisions.</li>
        </ol>

            <h2>Terminology</h2>
        </header>
            <p>We attempt to use terminology consistent with OSM’s language for pedestrian ways. We use “sidewalks” to
                delineate pedestrian-accessible footways associated with larger streets. Our standard applies to the
                broader category of “pedestrian ways” or a “pedestrian network,” which includes all paths, sidewalks,
                crossings, and other routes that are accessible by foot or with the use of assistive devices, regardless
                of accessibility by other forms of transportation.</p>
